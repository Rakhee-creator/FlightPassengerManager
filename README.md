✈️ Flight Passenger Manager (Arrays & Collections)
## 📖 Learning Journey
This project is part of my backend journey, learning under the guidance of **Copilot — My Miracle Guru** 🌞. 

📖 Overview
This project simulates a simple aviation passenger management system using Java Arrays and ArrayLists.
It demonstrates core backend concepts such as:
•	Adding passengers and seat assignments
•	Printing a passenger manifest
•	Searching for passengers by name
•	Updating seat assignments
•	Handling cancellations
•	Tracking  seats count
The project is inspired by aviation systems, reflecting backend logic that powers real-world airlines.

🚀 Features
•	Passenger Manifest → Print all passengers with their seat numbers
•	Search Functionality → Find a passenger and display their seat dynamically
•	Cancellation Simulation → Remove a passenger and update the manifest safely
•	Update Seat Assignments → Modify seat numbers for existing passengers
•	Capacity Tracking → Count filled vs empty seats

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Language: Java
•	Collections Used: ArrayList
•	Concepts Covered: Arrays, Traversal, Search, Update, Remove, Dynamic Index Handling

📂 Project Structure
FlightPassengerManager.java
•	main() → Entry point
•	ArrayList<String> → Stores passengers and seat numbers
•	Loops and conditions → Handle traversal, search, update, and cancellation

🌈 Future Enhancements
•	Create a Passenger class for cleaner object-oriented design
•	Add input via Scanner for dynamic passenger entry
•	Integrate sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion) for seat order
•	Extend to 2D Arrays for multi-flight management
